The important advantage of this construct is we can stop worrying about ‚Äúthread safety‚Äù altogether. Thread safety comes for free because all you have is only one thread anyway.\nNow, I‚Äôve heard blanket statements about the performance of Node.js applications due to its lack of multiple threads. This is kind of silly, but a counterargument would need a post of its own. However, I will state this:\nNode.js is used in several production workloads. Redis runs on a Single Threaded Event Loop! What is an ‚ÄúEvent Loop‚Äù? I will try to explain this with an example that I read long back (I forgot where).\nAssume our JavaScript code is King. The King has to meet several people over the day, take several decisions, send them to different tasks, and deal with them when they come back as well. Also, he meets each of them one by one only.\nWhat if someone comes to meet the King but the King is already in a meeting? This person will wait in a queue outside the door of King‚Äôs meeting room. As soon as a meeting is done, the first person in the queue can go into the meeting room.\nI hope you are catching the drift here üòÉ, the below diagram should explain the concept.\nThe JavaScript code we write is always waiting for an event to happen. Like the click of a button in the UI. When the event happens, it gets queued, and will wait for it to be picked up. As soon as it is picked up, the JavaScript engine will find the part of the code that should receive that event, execute it, and be done with it. The code could emit new events if it would like. Of course, as a downside of this approach, we had to deal with ‚Äúcallback hell‚Äù. This got addressed to a certain extent over the years, first by promise and then by async/await.\nHow to implement Event Loop in Go? Or why would we? It‚Äôs not that we implement a new JavaScript engine every other day. One reason I got interested in Event Loop is CodeCrafters challenges. In particular, their Build your own Redis challenge talks about using Event Loop implementation. If you happen to implement an Event Loop for a production use case, consider yourself lucky!\n(BTW, I highly recommend CodeCrafters challenges)\nLet‚Äôs talk about implementing Event Loop for Redis in Go. Like almost everything else, there are several ways to implement an Event Loop with varying levels of benefits and caveats. Let‚Äôs see,\nUsing Goroutines In this approach, we maintain one Goroutine for Event Loop. Assume this is the single thread. All data updates happen in this thread. We will deal with receiving, parsing, and responding to TCP connections in a different Goroutine. Like below,\nBut you might say, ‚ÄúOh.. that is not a single thread!‚Äù. Please bear with me until we get to the bottom of this üòÉ.\nFor this kind of approach, the event loop on the main thread will look like this,\nfunc loop(chcmd chan command) { dict := make(map[string]string) for { cmd := \u003c-chcmd cmd.resp \u003c- execute(cmd, dict) } } We are receiving the command in the command channel. As soon as we get a command, we execute it and send the response in the response channel - After which we will wait for the next command.\nOn the client Goroutine side, once we receive the command from the client, we send it in the command channel, and then wait for a response. Once we get a response we can write it back and then wait for the next request from the same client. Like below,\nfunc handle(conn net.Conn, chcmd chan command) { r := bufio.NewReader(conn) for { c, err := readCommand(r) if err != nil { // Possibly because the client disconnected return } chcmd \u003c- c resp := \u003c-c.resp conn.Write([]byte(\"+\" + resp + \"\\r\\n\")) } } We would need another Goroutine to accept connections from new clients and start their goroutine, like below,\nfunc start(l net.Listener, chcmd chan command) { for { conn, err := l.Accept() if err != nil { fmt.Println(\"Error accepting connection: \", err.Error()) panic(err) } go handle(conn, chcmd) } } And to tie them all together,\nfunc main() { l, err := net.Listen(\"tcp\", \"0.0.0.0:6379\") if err != nil { fmt.Println(\"Failed to bind to port 6379\") panic(err) } fmt.Println(\"Accepting connections\") chcmd := make(chan command) go start(l, chcmd) loop(chcmd) } A complete working code is available in the gist here.\nAn important concept to understand here is that Go natively allows only blocking IO. What it means is an API call like reader.ReadLine() in the bufio package is a blocking call*. The execution will not move forward on that thread (goroutine) until there is something to read. This prevents us from implementing the whole Event Loop in a single Goroutine. This kind of makes sense from Go‚Äôs point-of-view since Goroutines is the main USP of Go.\nNon blocking IO We can achieve non-blocking IO in Go, but we will have to roll on our own. We need to rely on the syscall package and make direct system calls. For the same reason, the below implementation will be compatible only with Unix-like operating systems (Linux / Mac).\nAgain there are multiple ways of doing this by mixing varying levels of native Go and syscall implementations. For simplicity, let us stick with syscall as much as possible.\nTo start a server:\nfunc startServer() (int, error) { sfd, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_STREAM, 0) if err != nil { return 0, err } var sa syscall.SockaddrInet4 sa.Port = 6379 sa.Addr = [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0} err = syscall.Bind(sfd, \u0026sa) if err != nil { return 0, err } err = syscall.Listen(sfd, 50) if err != nil { return 0, err } err = syscall.SetNonblock(sfd, true) if err != nil { return 0, err } return sfd, nil } The important line to notice is the syscall.SetNonblock(sfd, true). This is what makes the sfd (Server File Descriptor) a non-blocking one. Now whenever we try to accept a connection, it‚Äôs a non-blocking call, we might get an EAGAIN error which we need to ignore and keep looping.\nBut instead, if we get a new cfd (Client File Descriptior), we need to set that as a non-blocking one and keep track of it. Like below,\nfunc accept(sfd int) (int, bool, error) { isNew := true cfd, _, err := syscall.Accept(sfd) if err != nil { if shouldRetry(err) { isNew = false } else { return -1, isNew, err } } if isNew { err = syscall.SetNonblock(cfd, true) if err != nil { return -1, isNew, err } } return cfd, isNew, nil } Now in the main loop, we need to do two things\nCheck if there are new connections on the sfd using accept Check if there is a request in existing connections (cfds), if it is there, we need to handle that request. Like below, func loop(sfd int) error { cfds := []int{} dict := make(map[string]string) for { // Handle new connections cfd, isNew, err := accept(sfd) if err != nil { return err } if isNew { cfds = append(cfds, cfd) } ncfds := []int{} // Check existing connections for _, cfd := range cfds { ctd, err := handle(cfd, dict) if err != nil { return err } if ctd { ncfds = append(ncfds, cfd) } } cfds = ncfds } } Note that while handling an existing cfd also, we need to make sure to ignore the EAGAIN errors,\nfunc handle(cfd int, dict map[string]string) (bool, error) { ctd := true data := make([]byte, 2000) n, err := syscall.Read(cfd, data) if err != nil { if shouldRetry(err) { return ctd, nil } return ctd, err } ... The fully working gist is available here.\nKqueue Can we do better? Yes. The kernel itself provides a set of APIs to help with IO notifications. In FreeBSD-like operating systems (Including macOS), there is kqueue API. In Linux, there is epoll API. In this post, we will talk about kqueue. How this works is,\nCreate a new kqueue. Whenever there is a new File Descriptor we are interested in (Say sfd or cfd), we provide that to kqueue. We wait for new events from kqueue (blocking call). As soon as there is a new event, we will check if it is for sfd or cfd and process it accordingly. We don‚Äôt need to keep track of all the cfds anymore, since that is handled by kqueue. Also, we won‚Äôt worry about EAGAIN error either, since we know something is waiting on that fd before making an API call.\nLet‚Äôs see how the implementation is going to change. Let us add a generic function to add an fd to a kqueue,\nfunc addEvent(kq int, fd int) error { ev := syscall.Kevent_t{ Ident: uint64(fd), // Filter read operations Filter: syscall.EVFILT_READ, Flags: syscall.EV_ADD, } _, err := syscall.Kevent(kq, []syscall.Kevent_t{ev}, nil, nil) if err != nil { return err } return nil } Now, as soon as we start the server, let‚Äôs add sfd to kqueue and then initiate the loop,\nfunc main() { sfd, err := startServer() if err != nil { panic(err) } defer syscall.Close(sfd) // Create kqueue kq, err := syscall.Kqueue() if err != nil { panic(err) } // Add sfd to kqueue err = addEvent(kq, sfd) if err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Println(\"Accepting connections\") err = loop(kq, sfd) if err != nil { panic(err) } } And in a loop we,\nWait for an event from kqueue blocking call) Once there is an event, check if it is for the server or client. If it is for the server, initiate an accept. If it is for a client, initiate a handle request function. See below, func loop(kq int, sfd int) error { dict := make(map[string]string) for { events := make([]syscall.Kevent_t, 100) n, err := syscall.Kevent(kq, nil, events, nil) // There is a possible EINTR error for which we need to retry. if err != nil \u0026\u0026 !shouldRetry(err) { return err } for i := 0; i \u003c n; i++ { if events[i].Ident == uint64(sfd) { err = accept(\u0026events[i], kq, sfd) if err != nil { return err } } else { cfd := int(events[i].Ident) err = handle(cfd, dict) if err != nil { return err } } } } } The accept has to change too, now that we don‚Äôt need to worry about the EAGAIN error, however, we need to add new cfds to kqueue,\nfunc accept(ev *syscall.Kevent_t, kq int, sfd int) error { cfd, _, err := syscall.Accept(sfd) if err != nil { return err } err = syscall.SetNonblock(cfd, true) if err != nil { return err } err = addEvent(kq, cfd) if err != nil { return err } return nil } And a minor change in handle not to worry about the EAGAIN error anymore,\nfunc handle(cfd int, dict map[string]string) error { data := make([]byte, 2000) n, err := syscall.Read(cfd, data) if err != nil { return err } if n \u003e 0 { ... Again, a fully working gist here.\nSummary We looked at what is an Event Loop, how it works, and how to implement it in three different ways in Go,\nGoroutines: Possibly the most idiomatic way to do this in Go. Nonblocking IO: We need to roll our own using syscall package. Sample code supported only for Unix-based Operating Systems. Kqueue : Using OS-level API for event notification on file descriptors. With sample code supported only for FreeBSD-based Operating Systems (including macOS). Albeit written in C, Redis uses the kqueue/epoll implementation. So does the libuv implementation used by Node.js.\nThanks for reading, let me know in the comments what you think, if anything needs further clarification, or if you would want to see a Linux / Windows implementation, whatever.

}
</code></pre><p>The important line to notice is the <code>syscall.SetNonblock(sfd, true)</code>. This is what makes the <code>sfd</code> (Server File Descriptor) a non-blocking one. Now whenever we try to <code>accept</code> a connection, it&rsquo;s a non-blocking call, we might get an <code>EAGAIN</code> error which we need to ignore and keep looping.</p><p>But instead, if we get a new <code>cfd</code> (Client File Descriptior), we need to set that as a non-blocking one and keep track of it. Like below,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>func accept(sfd int) (int, bool, error) {
	isNew := true
	cfd, _, err := syscall.Accept(sfd)
	if err != nil {
		if shouldRetry(err) {
			isNew = false
		} else {
			return -1, isNew, err
		}
	}

	if isNew {
		err = syscall.SetNonblock(cfd, true)
		if err != nil {
			return -1, isNew, err
		}
	}
	return cfd, isNew, nil
}
</code></pre><p>Now in the main loop, we need to do two things</p><ul><li>Check if there are new connections on the <code>sfd</code> using <code>accept</code></li><li>Check if there is a request in existing connections (<code>cfds</code>), if it is there, we need to handle that request.
Like below,</li></ul><pre tabindex=0><code>func loop(sfd int) error {
	cfds := []int{}
	dict := make(map[string]string)

	for {
		// Handle new connections
		cfd, isNew, err := accept(sfd)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		if isNew {
			cfds = append(cfds, cfd)
		}

		ncfds := []int{}
		// Check existing connections
		for _, cfd := range cfds {
			ctd, err := handle(cfd, dict)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			if ctd {
				ncfds = append(ncfds, cfd)
			}
		}
		cfds = ncfds
	}
}
</code></pre><p>Note that while handling an existing <code>cfd</code> also, we need to make sure to ignore the <code>EAGAIN</code> errors,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>func handle(cfd int, dict map[string]string) (bool, error) {
	ctd := true
	data := make([]byte, 2000)

Yes. The kernel itself provides a set of APIs to help with IO notifications. In FreeBSD-like operating systems (Including macOS), there is <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&amp;sektion=2"><code>kqueue</code></a> API. In Linux, there is <a href=https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html><code>epoll</code></a> API. In this post, we will talk about <code>kqueue</code>. How this works is,</p><ul><li>Create a new <code>kqueue</code>.</li><li>Whenever there is a new File Descriptor we are interested in (Say <code>sfd</code> or <code>cfd</code>), we provide that to <code>kqueue</code>.</li><li>We wait for new events from <code>kqueue</code> (blocking call). As soon as there is a new event, we will check if it is for <code>sfd</code> or <code>cfd</code> and process it accordingly.</li></ul><p>We don&rsquo;t need to keep track of all the <code>cfds</code> anymore, since that is handled by <code>kqueue</code>. Also, we won&rsquo;t worry about <code>EAGAIN</code> error either, since we know something is waiting on that <code>fd</code> before making an API call.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see how the implementation is going to change. Let us add a generic function to add an <code>fd</code> to a <code>kqueue</code>,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>func addEvent(kq int, fd int) error {
	ev := syscall.Kevent_t{
		Ident: uint64(fd),
		// Filter read operations
		Filter: syscall.EVFILT_READ,
		Flags:  syscall.EV_ADD,
	}

	_, err := syscall.Kevent(kq, []syscall.Kevent_t{ev}, nil, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
</code></pre><p>Now, as soon as we start the server, let&rsquo;s add <code>sfd</code> to <code>kqueue</code> and then initiate the loop,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>func main() {

	sfd, err := startServer()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer syscall.Close(sfd)

	// Create kqueue
	kq, err := syscall.Kqueue()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Add sfd to kqueue
	err = addEvent(kq, sfd)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(&#34;Accepting connections&#34;)

	err = loop(kq, sfd)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
</code></pre><p>And in a loop we,</p><ul><li>Wait for an event from <code>kqueue</code> blocking call)</li><li>Once there is an event, check if it is for the server or client.<ul><li>If it is for the server, initiate an <code>accept</code>.</li><li>If it is for a client, initiate a handle request function.
See below,</li></ul></li></ul><pre tabindex=0><code>func loop(kq int, sfd int) error {
	dict := make(map[string]string)
	for {
		events := make([]syscall.Kevent_t, 100)
		n, err := syscall.Kevent(kq, nil, events, nil)
		// There is a possible EINTR error for which we need to retry.
		if err != nil &amp;&amp; !shouldRetry(err) {
			return err
		}

		for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
			if events[i].Ident == uint64(sfd) {
				err = accept(&amp;events[i], kq, sfd)
				if err != nil {
					return err
				}
			} else {
				cfd := int(events[i].Ident)
				err = handle(cfd, dict)
				if err != nil {
					return err
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>accept</code> has to change too, now that we don&rsquo;t need to worry about the <code>EAGAIN</code> error, however, we need to add new <code>cfd</code>s to <code>kqueue</code>,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>func accept(ev *syscall.Kevent_t, kq int, sfd int) error {
	cfd, _, err := syscall.Accept(sfd)

	}

	err = addEvent(kq, cfd)
	if err != nil {

	return nil

	data := make([]byte, 2000)
	n, err := syscall.Read(cfd, data)
